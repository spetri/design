                    <p>I graduated with two degrees: <span>Computer Science</span> and <span>Art History</span>.</p>
                    <p>After university, I took my <span>Computer Science</span> degree and spent a few years internationally as a full-stack developer. We solved challenging technical problems, while taking part in the development and evolution of our cultural processes. What started as a mishmash of segmented teams evolved into one unified team, learning to perform stand-ups, pair programming, estimation practices, and much more, all under an Agile umbrella.</p>
                    <p>Over time, my vision and scope began to broaden, as I enjoyed looking at product vision and how products could be enhanced from a market viewpoint. I also began to take strong interest in the other teams working with the developers, forming stronger bonds between them. Beginning to wield my <span>Art History</span> background, I analyzed and interpreted user workflows, consulted with the business to elicit requirements / discussed user experience, and took a fresh look at the business processes that surrounded our products.</p>
                    <p>Coming back to my California home, I've taken the knowledge gained and put it to good use. While I will always write code and continue to contribute to open-source projects, my focus is now toward product management and design.</p>
